# Speaker Recognition System

### Markov Models

Markov models can be used to capture the statistical relationships present in a language like English. These models allow us to go beyond simplistic observations, like the frequency with which specific letters or words appear in a language, and instead to capture the relationships between words or letters in sequences. As a result, we can not only appreciate that the letter “q” appears in text at a certain rate, but also that it is virtually always followed by a “u.” Similarly, “to be” is a much more likely word sequence than “to is.”

One application of Markov models is in analyzing actual text and assessing the likelihood that a particular person uttered it. That is one objective of this assignment.

Markov models are used significantly in speech recognition systems, and used heavily in the domains of natural language processing, machine learning, and AI.


### Separate Chaining

Separate chaining is a method of collision resolution in hash tables. When a collision occurs, the new item is added to the end of a linked list. This allows for multiple items to be stored in the same cell. The `Hashtable` class will use separate chaining to resolve collisions.
